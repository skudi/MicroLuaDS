I- Package content |
-------------------+

This package contains the following files and directories:

* <luads>: this is the main directory. Please do not rename it, otherwise you may have compilation errors (which could however be fixed by simply changing some paths in the right files).

* <docs>: this directory DOES NOT contain any help to compile (this readme does contain this help). The files herein are used to make HTML files from the Wiki pages, and thus create offline version of the Wiki as it is available on the GC.

* <Fat>: this is exactly how the root of the cartridge would look like. That is to say in contains the 'lua' folder.

* <efsroot>: this folder is only useful to who whishes to provide a all-in-one pack of his program. Take a look at "III- How to compile using EFS" for more informations about this.

* <lua-5.1.3>: the sources of Lua, with many files modified to be run on NDS, and many other things about compiling Lua.
    + <src>: the sources.
        - <ds>: MicroLua sources that are coded in C (because some are coded in Lua in 'libs.lua').

* <source>: this directory contains the main file of MicroLua, which will create the final binary.

* 'Compile All.bat' and 'Compile DS.bat': main files that ease compilation under Windows environment; the latter only compiles the 'source' folder, as the first also recreates the Lua library.

* 'Makefile': the main Makefile.

* 'logo.bmp' and 'logo_wifi.bmp': really obvious isn't it?

* 'README.TXT': the file you're now reading. You have all my gratitude for reading it! ;)

* 'LICENSE.TXT': this file describes how MicroLua is distributed.

II- How to compile |
-------------------+

I'm too lazy to write here the instructions, so I will simply give you the link to the right page of the Wiki :
>>> http://code.google.com/p/microlua/wiki/HowToCompile?wl=en <<<

III- How to compile using EFS |
------------------------------+

The step are actually identical with compiling "without" it, because 'luads.nds' is always patched with EFS. However, if you put something in the 'efsroot' folder, it will be included in the Embedded File System.
On startup, MicroLua will look for its main directory, first on Fat, and then on EFS. So, assuming there is not 'lua' directory on the 킪D, if you have correctly put a 'lua' folder in 'efsroot' before the compilation, MicroLua will use this folder. Thus, by replacing 'shell.lua' by the 'index.lua' of your project (or at least tweaking MicroLua so it boots you own script), you get your own NDS binary!
I want however warn you that this way is NOT recommended. Not that it doesn't work well (it does), but whenever a user has several 킠ua scripts it is far more convenient for him to keep only one MicroLua interpretor instead of a dozen. So please privilegiate sharing your scripts directly than a fat, heavy, ugly NDS binary.

IV- General informations |
-------------------------+

The sources of MicroLua are placed in three folders : 'Fat/lua/', 'source' and 'lua-5.1.3/src/ds'. Yes, this is not great, and we once planned to put everything at the same place ('source').
If you intend to work on MicroLua, you will probably modify the files that are in those places.

Hint for Windows-users: there are two '.bat' files about compiling. 'Compile DS.bat' is intended to compile only the files that are in 'source', when 'Compile All.bat' will also compile the files in 'lua-5.1.3/src/ds'.

Once you have made your improvements, please make sure that the files you are about to commit are the good ones. I mean, before doing some mass file adding in your commit, check that there are no useless files like 'luads.nds', only keep the sources.
I will not make other advices about managing your work, please just be sure that what you did will work fine (not like I have already done!).

* http://www.microlua.xooit.fr: the main MicroLua's site
*__ (actually this is a forum). The active community will help
*__ you progress and share your scripts ;) Probably THE place you
*__ should check everyday.

* http://code.google.com/p/microlua/: MicroLua's project hosting
*__ on Google servers. If you want to have the real last MicroLua
*__ release, go check it! There is also a good Wiki with tons of
*__ informations ;)

* http://www.lua.org: the official Lua website. You can find here
*__ all the informations relative to the language; this will
*__ probably be useful to you if you intend to make some
*__ homebrews with uLua unless you already know by heart the
*__ language :p

VI- Credits and other background informations |
----------------------------------------------+

All the thanks will first go to Risike, the true owner of the 
project, the Creator, our God (let's stop here), as the project 
originally comes from him. He released the first version of 
MicroLua in 2008, and maintained it until 2009 (v3.0). At this 
point, he stated that he didn't want to continue this project and 
released it open source.
But we, the community, took care of it, and continued the work. 
MicroLua sources are of course available.
People who must be thanked are Papymouge, at least for his great
job on Wifi, Ced-le-pingouin, for working on the compilation
process and for his great MLS, Grahack which have so many good
(or not) ideas on how to drive uLua, Ghuntar, thomh@ck,
thermo_nono and myself Reylak, for this soooo beautiful README
file ;) And last but not least of course, all the community for
creating such magnificient homebrews and supporting us!

One last thing about uLua: some people confuse MicroLua with Lua.
Lua is a language, basically used on computers either stand-alone
or as a plugin engine. uLua is meant to be an adaptation of Lua
for the Nintendo DS. So please, MicroLua is NOT a language; LUA
is the language. That's all, folks :)

I now just have to thank also you for downloading the sources and 
maybe improving MicroLua! I hope this way you will enjoy much
more MicroLua!


                                                           Reylak
